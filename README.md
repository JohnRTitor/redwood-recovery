Recovery For Poco X5 Pro AOSP ROMs

## How to install

If you have AOSP-based recovery (Los recovery, Arrow recovery etc.) just sideload.
command: adb sideload (recovery-name).zip

If you have TWRP/OFOX/etc. that can directly flash zips, just flash.

Download files TWRP_flashable or OFOX_flashable from [the releases page](https://github.com/JohnRTitor/redwood-recovery/releases/latest).

## Disclaimer

1. Although they are fully tested, I am not responsible for any bricked devices. The choice and responsibility of using these is your own.
2. I do not maintain these recoveries. My job is to provide flashable zips for these recoveries which can be flashed by an existing recovery.
